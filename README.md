# Online Bookstore SQL Project

**Repository name:** `online-bookstore-sql`

## Project overview
This SQL project contains practice queries for an Online Bookstore dataset. It uses three CSV files (`Books.csv`, `Customers.csv`, `Orders.csv`) that share at least one common column for joins (e.g., `Customer_ID`, `Book_ID`). The tasks include basic retrievals, aggregations and intermediate-level (advance) queries.
